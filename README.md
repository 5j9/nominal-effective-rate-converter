💰 Interest Rate Converter
-
A clean and simple web-based financial calculator designed to convert any given interest rate (Nominal or Effective Period Rate) into its equivalent rates across different compounding frequencies (Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).

This tool is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✨ Features
-
* Bidirectional Conversion: Enter a rate into any field, and the calculator instantly updates all other equivalent rates.
* Three-Column Structure: Clearly displays the Stated Annual Rate (Nominal) and the Effective Period Rate for each compounding period.
* Effective Annual Rate (EAR) Clarity: The true Effective Annual Rate (EAR) is derived from, and displayed in, the Annual row under the Effective Period Rate column.
* Future Value Calculation: Calculate the future value of a principal amount based on the active effective rate and a custom time horizon (Years, Months, or Days).
* Concise and Maintainable: Separated CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript (script.js) for clean code structure.
